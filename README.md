## eBills
##### by _**Uriel Gonzalez**_

### Description
I wanted to create a model for a financial website in React.js. Something essential that I would use. With that in mind I decided to create a website where users can pay bills their utility bills.

On eBills, users can:
```
* Log In/Off, Sign Up and reset their password. Authentication developed with Firebase.
* Pick a pre existing (hard coded/fake) utility company
* Add/Edit a company
* Set up a payment
* Make a payment. The code with the capability is done (see the payment form js file under Components), but I need to go through the authorization process and other steps at SquareUp, which is the platform I used.
* See their payment history
* Project in progress, more functions and better styling coming soon.
```
