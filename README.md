## eBills
##### by _**Uriel Gonzalez**_

### Description
As a business minded person I wanted to build a service of essential use for everyone. A model for a financial website I could potentially sell after full development. With that in mind I decided to start building a website where users can pay their utility bills, all in one place. This project is currently in progress and constantly changing as my learning advances.

On eBills, users can:
```
* Log In/Off, Sign Up and reset their password.
* Read a list of pre existing (hard coded) utility companies.
* Add/Edit a utility company.
* Set up/schedule a payment.
* To make a payment; The code with the capability is created (see the payment form js file under Components), but I need activate payment authorization at SquareUp in order to make real payments, which is the platform I used.
* See the user's payment history.
* Project in progress, more functions and better styling in progress.
```
